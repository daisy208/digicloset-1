Thanks for helping improve this project! A few quick guidelines:
- Create a branch named `feature/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` (or `pytest`) before creating a PR.
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md when appropriate.
