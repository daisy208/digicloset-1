DigiCloset Upgrade Pack - Uploadable code skeleton

This archive contains a minimal, functional skeleton to start implementing the upgrade pack:
  - backend/ : FastAPI skeleton with auth, upload, and infer endpoints (in-memory demo).
  - model-service/: stub service for model inference (replace with real model).
  - infra/helm : helm chart skeleton.
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml : CI skeleton.

Use this as a starting point. The services are intentionally lightweight to get a working local dev flow.
