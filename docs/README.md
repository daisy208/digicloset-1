# 👕 DigiCloset

**DigiCloset is an enterprise-oriented wardrobe management and outfit-planning platform designed to demonstrate how AI-driven personalization systems can be built, deployed, and operated at production scale.**

While the domain is wardrobe management, the core focus of this project is **enterprise-grade system design**, not consumer novelty.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Is

DigiCloset is a **production-ready v1 enterprise application** that demonstrates:

* AI-assisted recommendation workflows
* End-to-end system architecture
* Real-world deployment considerations
* Maintainability, observability, and extensibility planning

The wardrobe use case serves as a **concrete, understandable domain** for showcasing enterprise AI system design.

---

## ❌ What This Project Is Not

* Not a demo or proof-of-concept
* Not a UI-only prototype
* Not a framework or SDK
* Not a consumer-focused startup pitch

It is an **engineering-focused, deployable system** built to reflect real production constraints.

---

## 🧩 Problem It Addresses (Enterprise Lens)

Many AI projects fail in production due to:

* Poor system boundaries
* Lack of operational readiness
* Overfocus on models instead of systems

DigiCloset addresses this by implementing:

* A complete AI-backed product workflow
* Clear separation of concerns (data, services, API, UI)
* Realistic assumptions about deployment and iteration

The domain is simple — the **engineering discipline is not**.

---

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

* Structured data modeling for user-owned assets
* AI-assisted recommendation logic
* End-to-end request → inference → response flow
* Deployable architecture suitable for real users
* Clear upgrade paths for scale, security, and compliance

---

## 🚀 How the System Is Used (High Level)

1. Users manage structured inventory (wardrobe items)
2. Data flows through defined services
3. AI logic operates within controlled boundaries
4. Results are surfaced through a usable interface

The emphasis is on **system correctness and clarity**, not novelty.

---

## 📦 Project Status

**Production-ready v1 (Enterprise-Oriented)**

This indicates:

* The system is deployable today
* Core flows are implemented and functional
* Architectural decisions are intentional and documented
* Known limitations are acknowledged transparently

This is a foundation, not a finished enterprise product.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Planned Enterprise Enhancements

* Codebase organization reflects rapid v1 delivery and will be refactored into stricter domain modules
* Large-scale performance and fault-injection testing is pending
* Enterprise features such as SSO, RBAC, and compliance tooling are future work

These gaps are expected at this stage and explicitly planned.

---

## 🛠 Technical Focus (Primary Audience)

This project is intended for:

* Engineers
* Reviewers
* Mentors
* Judges evaluating system design maturity

Key areas of focus include:

* Architecture decisions
* AI integration patterns
* Production readiness considerations
* Tradeoffs made during v1 delivery

---

## 🎓 Why This Project Exists

DigiCloset was built to:

* Practice enterprise-level AI system design early
* Move beyond toy examples and demos
* Learn how production constraints shape software

The goal is **engineering growth through realistic execution**.

---

## 💬 Feedback & Review

Feedback is welcome, especially around:

* Architectural clarity
* Maintainability
* Production-readiness assumptions
* Enterprise scalability considerations
